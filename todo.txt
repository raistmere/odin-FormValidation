// List of things I want to add to the project: //

I will like to add a slide down effect on the error box message 
for validation. If the input is not valid, the error box (that is
underneath each input box) will have a slide down effect rather than
a instant pop up effect. Maybe have it slide from behind the input box
and drop down.

Display an (x) next to the input field that has a validation error. 
This only shows when the submit button is pressed for a secondary visual 
feedback for the user.
